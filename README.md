# odysync

An applicance for synchronizing a YouTube channel to one on the LBRY blockchain (and therefore OdySee).

## WorkInProgress !

Use of this application is ill-advised at the moment.

Currently requires a regenerated [PyBRY](https://pypi.org/project/pybry/) client; upstream changes pending (and possibly fixed by now)
